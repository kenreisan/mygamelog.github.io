# Just for fun!

I started to learn javascript, my first project is a simulator for a gacha game based on the game Azur Lane.

## What is a gacha game?

Is like a lottery, are based on the gashapon vending toys machines of Japan.
You will spend in-game money to pull for random prizes, some more rares than others.
